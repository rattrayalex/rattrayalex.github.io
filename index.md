    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I've been starting things for as long as I can remember.

      In the past, Iâ€™ve built a <a href="http://lightscript.org" target="_blank">programming language</a>,
      a campus bikeshare, an underground student newspaper,
      a pretty intense <a href="https://narwallmask.com" target="_blank">COVID mask</a>,
      and a dozen-odd other projects and businesses.

      From 2017-2020, I worked at Stripe, where I:<br>
      - Shipped a <a href="https://twitter.com/stripe/status/1108764635606315008" target="_blank">redesign</a> of Stripe's API Docs.<br>
      - Shipped the Stripe API's <a href="https://twitter.com/stripe/status/1222944951853432832" target="_blank">TypeScript definitions</a>.<br>
      - Designed the patent-pending codegen system that powers Stripe's API client libraries and docs.<br>
      - Led incident response for one of Stripe's most severe degradations.<br>

<h2 class="page-header">About me:</h2>
<p>
  I have been "starting things" for almost as long as I can remember.
</p>
<p>
  In high school,
  I pitched energy-saving signage to Seattle's electricity utility,
  started an underground student newspaper,
  and even sold custom upcycled bookbags.
</p>
<p>
  As a student at Penn, I cofounded
  <a href="http://penncycle.org">a bike share</a>
  before learning to code and building
  <a href="http://coursegrapher.com">several</a>
  <a href="http://histography.com">award-winning</a>
  <a href="pando.com/2013/01/22/meet-musical-toilet-the-latest-innovation-in-the-connected-bathroom/">hackathon projects</a>
  and other apps. I also cofounded
  <a href="http://emeraldexam.com">Emerald Exam</a>,
  an education technology product funded by
  First Round Capital's
  <a href="http://dormroomfund.com">Dorm Room Fund</a>.
</p>
<p>
  After school,
  I took a year to travel in Asia,
  doing remote software consulting.
  I also took a three-month post at
  Bangalore-based
  <a href="http://babajob.com">Babajob.com</a>,
  a startup connecting undereducated job seekers
  with economic opportunities.
