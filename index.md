<h2 class="page-header">About me:</h2>
<p class="lead">
  I have been "starting things" for almost as long as I can remember.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  In high school,
  I pitched energy-saving signage to Seattle's electricity utility,
  started an underground student newspaper,
  and even sold custom upcycled bookbags.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  As a student at Penn,
  I created skincare products made from simple ingredients and
  cofounded <a href="http://penncycle.org">a bike share</a>
  before learning to code and
  building 
  <a href="http://coursegrapher.com">several</a> 
  <a href="http://histography.com">award-winning</a> 
  <a href="pando.com/2013/01/22/meet-musical-toilet-the-latest-innovation-in-the-connected-bathroom/">hackathon projects</a>
  and other apps.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  Most recently, I co-founded
  <a href="http://emeraldexam.com">Emerald Exam</a>,
  an education technology product used by thousands of students at
  over a dozen institutions to improve the exam experience.
  First Round Capital's
  <a href="http://dormroomfund.com">Dorm Room Fund</a>
  invested in the company, which we grew to seven people before closing
  our doors in March of 2014.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  I am currently taking a year to travel in Asia,
  doing software consulting as I go.
