<h2 class="page-header">About me:</h2>
<p class="lead">
  I have been "starting things" for almost as long as I can remember.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  In high school,
  I pitched energy-saving signage to Seattle's electricity utility,
  started an underground student newspaper,
  and even sold custom upcycled bookbags.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  As a student at Penn,
  I created skincare products made from simple ingredients and
  cofounded <a href="http://penncycle.org">a bike share</a>
  before learning to code and
  building 
  <a href="http://coursegrapher.com">several</a>

  <a href="pando.com/2013/01/22/meet-musical-toilet-the-latest-innovation-in-the-connected-bathroom/">hackathon projects</a>
  and other apps. I also cofounded
  <a href="http://emeraldexam.com">Emerald Exam</a>,
  an education technology product funded by
  First Round Capital's
  <a href="http://dormroomfund.com">Dorm Room Fund</a>.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  After closing Emerald Exam &amp; graduating in 2014, 
  I took a year to travel in Asia,
  doing remote software consulting.
  I also took a three-month post at
  Bangalore-based
  <a href="http://babajob.com">Babajob.com</a>, 
  a 250-person startup
  which connects undereducated job seekers 
  with economic opportunities.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  From October 2015 to January 2017,
  I worked as a Software Engineer at
  <a href="http://hired.com">Hired</a> in San Francisco
  with the goal of improving the labor market
  for job-seekers and employers.
